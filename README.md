# SwiftKDTree

A Swift port of [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann). Super experimental, but it's fast, and I'm using it with large datasets (molecular visualization). 

At the time I ported it, it was the fastest KD-tree in Swift that I knew of. I'd like to add performance benchmarks.
